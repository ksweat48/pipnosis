 * UNIFIED EQS THRESHOLD - SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH

 * All style-specific thresholds reference this value.
 *
 * To change the threshold for all styles, modify this constant ONLY.
 *
 * 75-POINT SCALE (REDUCED FROM 100):
 * Core structure (pullback + EMA + VWAP) is sufficient for entry.
 * Patterns are enhancers, not gatekeepers.
 * 40/75 EQS (53%) is sufficient for execution when price is in entry zone.
 *
 * NOTE: This is the BASELINE threshold. Alpha self-adjusts his assessment based

 * EQS-TO-CONFIDENCE MODIFIER — INFORMATION ONLY (NO PENALTIES)
 *
 * CCIP GOVERNANCE: EQS is a market context tool passed to Alpha for reasoning.
 * It describes the quality of the current entry structure.
 * EQS does NOT reduce confidence scores. Alpha sees the EQS value and reasons
 * about it directly in his analytical framework.
 *
 * Positive rewards for exceptional timing are preserved — they represent
 * alignment bonuses when market structure is textbook quality.
 * All negative modifiers (penalties) have been removed.
 *
 * Philosophy: Alpha needs to see poor entry quality as information, not as
 * a code-imposed penalty. If the entry structure is weak, Alpha will factor
 * that into his confidence output directly. Penalizing his confidence via code
 * distorts his output without giving him the knowledge to reason differently.
 *
 * 75-POINT SCALE:
 * REWARDS (Above 50):
 * - 75+: +5 points (exceptional timing — textbook entry structure)
 * - 70-74: +4 points
 * - 65-69: +3 points
 * - 60-64: +2 points
 * - 55-59: +1 points
 * - 50 and below: +0 points (neutral — Alpha reasons about EQS directly)

 * ADAPTIVE CONFIDENCE FLOOR RAILS — SSOT
 *
 * CCIP-2026-0308A: Bidirectional Floor Authority
 *
 * Alpha's execution floor is adaptive — it moves both up AND down based on
 * calibration data from alpha_confidence_calibration. Hard system rails prevent
 * extremes that would either expose capital (too low) or lock Alpha out of
 * all valid setups (too high).
 *
 * FLOOR_DEFAULT: Where every session starts. Matches MINIMUM_TRADE_CONFIDENCE.
 * FLOOR_HARD_MIN: Absolute lower bound. Alpha cannot lower below this regardless
 *   of data. Protects against systematic over-acceptance of low-conviction trades.
 * FLOOR_HARD_MAX: Absolute upper bound. Alpha cannot raise above this regardless
 *   of data. Protects against data-driven lockout where no trade ever qualifies.
 * FLOOR_STEP: Increment/decrement unit. One bucket width (5 points) per adjustment.
 *   Prevents erratic jumps from a single calibration event.
 *
 * SAMPLE_SIZE_THRESHOLD_DOWN: Minimum trades in a bucket to allow floor lowering.
 *   Lower bar — relaxing the floor is less risky, needs less evidence.
 * SAMPLE_SIZE_THRESHOLD_UP: Minimum trades in a bucket to allow floor raising.
 *   Higher bar — raising the floor restricts trading and punishes future sessions.
 *   Requires stronger evidence before becoming more selective.
 *
 * CALIBRATION_ERROR_THRESHOLD: Minimum miscalibration magnitude to trigger any
 *   adjustment. Prevents noise from bouncing the floor on small deviations.
 *   A bucket must be wrong by this many percentage points before Alpha acts.
 *
 * AUTHORITY: This object is the ONLY place these rails are defined.
 * alpha-adaptive-floor-service.ts reads these values. No other file hardcodes them.

  const analyticalLens = `ANALYTICAL LENS — questions you answer for every scan:

Q1 TREND: What does ${controlTF} say about direction? Name the structure.
Q2 STRUCTURAL PATH: Trace entry to TP. Name every level, zone, and obstacle in the path. A TP in front of a credible obstacle is not a real TP.
Q3 PRIOR REJECTIONS: Has price visited this level before? What happened?
Q4 MOMENTUM: Where is the move in its stage? What does ${confirmationTF} show about confirmation?
Q5 DEVIL'S ADVOCATE: What is the most credible reason this fails? What probability? If failure probability is within 10 points of your confidence, name what keeps the edge alive in that margin. If failure probability meets or exceeds confidence, the trade has no probability advantage.
Q5B OBJECTIVE ALIGNMENT: Does this trade serve the session goal?
Q6 ENTRY TRIGGER: Name the specific observable event that confirms entry. Proximity is not a trigger.
Q7 CONFLUENCE: Work through TREND, STRUCTURE, MOMENTUM, TIMING, LIQUIDITY, PATTERN, OMEGA_CONSENSUS. For each, state whether it is genuinely confirmed with a specific named data point. Determine how many confirmed dimensions this specific trade in this specific context needs to have a defensible edge — that is your judgment. State that number. State how many you confirmed. If it falls short, NO_TRADE is your conclusion.
Q8 RANGE POSITION: How far into the projected move are you? Where in the session range is price?
Q8C PRICE LOCATION: DISCOUNT / EQUILIBRIUM / PREMIUM within the ${controlTF} range.
Q8D WEEKLY NARRATIVE: Does the weekly delivery context support your direction?
Q9 SL WICK PROXIMITY: Scan recent ${primaryTF} candles for wick extremes near your SL. A stop inside a visible wick cluster gets swept before the thesis plays out.${isMicro || isIntraday ? `
Q10 TRADE MANAGEMENT: How you manage the two targets is part of this decision. Decide now: what percentage at TP1, whether to move to breakeven, how you trail the runner and behind which structural level.` : ''}`;

The system provides you with raw market data: candles, EMA stack, ATR, Omega sensor observations, regime snapshot, adversarial signals, liquidity context, session data, and historical performance. You read all of it and decide.

Advisory systems (Regime Oracle, Adversarial Detector, Omega Council, Session Context) give you information. They do not block your decision and they do not modify your confidence mathematically. You read their signals as a professional reads market context — incorporating what is material, dismissing what is noise.
